### 💡 About Me

💻 I’m a passionate learner on the **ALX ProDev Backend track** who thrives at the intersection of:

- 🔧 **Software Engineering** — building robust, scalable backend systems
- ⚙️ **DevOps** — automating deployment and infrastructure as code
- 🛡️ **Cybersecurity** — securing applications, networks, and systems from real-world threats

🔍 I don’t just learn cybersecurity — I **practice ethical hacking**, simulate attacks, and understand how real-world exploits work.

### 🧭 What Drives Me

🌐 My mission is to build **secure, efficient, and scalable systems**, while staying ahead in a world full of vulnerabilities.

🧠 **Ethical hacking fuels my curiosity**, teaches me how attackers think, and helps me build stronger defenses from the ground up.
